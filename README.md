# blackboard-webscraper
A scraper designed to get total grades from the BlackBoard education management system.
BB was initially conceived at as a merger from a Cornell dorm-room startup and an education consulting duo. It has since become the bane of every student's existence. I have endeavored to make it more tolerable. We're using Selenium, because the developers at BB decided that if they were going to make janky software, they might as well make it jankier with Javascript. This project mostly serves as a way for me to procrastinate my UW homework (iykyk) and also to demonstrate how useless the grading feature is to students, since all professors have different grading schemes and locations where they post their grades. So have fun, and adapt this scraper however you like. But for the love of God, don't use it to scrape BlackBoard. Ask me how I know...
